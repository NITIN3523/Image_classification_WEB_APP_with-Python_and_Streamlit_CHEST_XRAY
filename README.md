***util.py:*** This file serves as a utility module, encapsulating reusable functions for the application. It likely contains two primary functions:

The first function is responsible for setting the background for the user interface.

The second function handles generating the score and classification results, presumably based on model predictions.

***main.py:*** This file acts as the application's entry point. It utilizes the Streamlit library to create a web application. Streamlit simplifies the process of building web interfaces from Python code. Within main.py, the application leverages the functionalities provided by util.py to potentially:

Display a background image.Present classification scores and results generated by the model.
